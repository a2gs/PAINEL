Process B will need to wait for process A to finish its transaction before starting a new transaction.

The SQLITE_MISMATCH error is returned in those few cases when the types do not match.\nThe rowid of a table must be an integer.

However, there is no guarantee that the detection of misuse will be successful. Misuse detection is probabilistic.
